      <p ><b>CAPE COAST CASTLE</b><br>
        Cape Coast Castle: A Historic Symbol of the Transatlantic Slave Trade
      Cape Coast Castle, located in the Central Region of Ghana, is one of the largest and most significant castles along the West African coast. Originally built by Swedish traders in 1653 for the gold trade, it was later seized and expanded by the British in the late 17th century. Under British control, the castle became a central hub for the transatlantic slave trade.
      Enslaved Africans were held in the castle's dungeons under inhumane conditions before being shipped to the Americas and the Caribbean. The "Door of No Return" symbolizes the final exit point for these individuals, who were forced to leave their homeland, never to return.
      Today, Cape Coast Castle serves as a museum and memorial, reminding the world of the atrocities of slavery. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a place of pilgrimage for people of African descent, offering a poignant reflection on the legacy of the slave trade.</p>
